# GetAJob
## Somewhere to get back up to speed with coding

This project has been set up so that I can get back in touch with my ***technical side***.

So the goals of this project are:-

1. Get a working knowledge of GIT
2. Get a working knowledge of node.js
3. Set up a basic React app
4. Skill back up on JavaScript
5. Use AI along the way to understand the tools available to the Engineers I'll be managing in my next role

---

I'll also use this ReadMe to list out any good documentation I use along the way.
